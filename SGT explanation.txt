Sequence Graph Transform (SGT) works by quantifying the patterns in a 
sequence by scanning the positions of all characters relative to each 
other. They call it a graph transform because of its inherent property 
of interpretation as a graph, where the characters form the nodes and 
a directed connection between two nodes shows their “association.” These 
“associations” between all characters represent the signature features 
of a sequence.  These feature vectors can then be used for various data 
mining activities such as clustering, finding most similar sequences and
trainig machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
